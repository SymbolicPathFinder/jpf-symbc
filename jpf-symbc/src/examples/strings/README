String Examples for Worst Case Analysis

Worst Case Analysis with String Constraints

Uses string constraint solver ABC to conduct WCA.

Three simple examples to demonstrate worst case 
behavior for string manipulating programs.

1. Password Checker Version 1

Source file: PassCheck.java

  Compares an input string to a stored password constant, 
  character by character. Has an early return if ever a
  character mismatch is doscovered. Worst case is when the 
  input is equal to the password, since then we itereate to
  the end of the character comparing loop.

JPF Configuration File: jpf/src/examples/PassCheck01.jpf

Running From Command Line:

  $ jpf PassCheck01.jpf

Expected Output:

  Worst case String Path Condition : 
  (declare-fun p_1 () String)

  (assert ( =  (charAt p_1 7) "d"))
  (assert ( =  (charAt p_1 6) "r"))
  (assert ( =  (charAt p_1 5) "0"))
  (assert ( =  (charAt p_1 4) "w"))
  (assert ( =  (charAt p_1 3) "$"))
  (assert ( =  (charAt p_1 2) "$"))
  (assert ( =  (charAt p_1 1) "a"))
  (assert ( =  (charAt p_1 0) "P"))
  (assert ( =  (len p_1) 8))
  (check-sat)

  String constraint values : p_1 : "Pa$$w0rd"
  Best case execution time : 3277
  Normalized worst case execution time : 135
  Timing channel capacity is 3.3219280948873626 bits.


2. Password Checker Version 2

Source file: PassCheck.java

  Compares an input string to a stored password constant, 
  character by character. Unlike Version 1, only return after
  checking the entire string. Worst case is any string that
  has length 8, which is not eqaul to the password. Our 
  current version return a result with unprintable ASCII
  characters, so it appeas that the worst case input has
  length 5. We need to fix ABC to either choose a printable
  example, or format unprintable characters as escape sequences. 

JPF Configuration File: PassCheck01.jpf

Running From Command Line:

  $ jpf PassCheck02.jpf

Expected Output:

  Worst case String Path Condition : 
  (declare-fun p_1 () String)

  (assert ( >=  8 (len p_1)))
  (assert ( <  7 (len p_1)))
  (assert ( =  (charAt p_1 6) "r"))
  (assert ( <  6 (len p_1)))
  (assert ( !=  (charAt p_1 5) "0"))
  (assert ( <  5 (len p_1)))
  (assert ( !=  (charAt p_1 4) "w"))
  (assert ( <  4 (len p_1)))
  (assert ( !=  (charAt p_1 3) "$"))
  (assert ( <  3 (len p_1)))
  (assert ( !=  (charAt p_1 2) "$"))
  (assert ( <  2 (len p_1)))
  (assert ( !=  (charAt p_1 1) "a"))
  (assert ( <  1 (len p_1)))
  (assert ( !=  (charAt p_1 0) "P"))
  (assert ( <  0 (len p_1)))
  (check-sat)

  String constraint values : p_1 : "ýû÷ïߜ"
  Best case execution time : 3334
  Normalized worst case execution time : 163
  Timing channel capacity is 4.459431618637297 bits.


3. String Searching

Source File: StringSearch.java

  Counts the number of occurences of a string within a 
  search string, using a naive character comparison method.
  
JPF COnfiguration File: StringSearch01.jpf

Running From Command Line: 

  $ jpf StringSearch01.jpf

Expected Output:

  Worst case String Path Condition : 
  (declare-fun haystack_1 () String)

  (assert ( >=  12 ( +  (len haystack_1) 1)))
  (assert ( !=  (charAt haystack_1 4) "<"))
  (assert ( <  11 ( +  (len haystack_1) 1)))
  (assert ( !=  (charAt haystack_1 3) "<"))
  (assert ( <  10 ( +  (len haystack_1) 1)))
  (assert ( !=  (charAt haystack_1 2) "<"))
  (assert ( <  9 ( +  (len haystack_1) 1)))
  (assert ( !=  (charAt haystack_1 1) "<"))
  (assert ( <  8 ( +  (len haystack_1) 1)))
  (assert ( !=  (charAt haystack_1 0) "<"))
  (assert ( <  7 ( +  (len haystack_1) 1)))
  (check-sat)

  String constraint values : haystack_1 : "ýû÷ï߿~ýû"
  Best case execution time : 3134
  Normalized worst case execution time : 700
  Timing channel capacity is 5.554588851677638 bits.
