/**
 * An extension of the previous visitor system created for GREEN solver integration
 * set up for a more robust purpose of handling the functionality previously done by
 * PCParser. All it changes about the previous system is the creation of literal 
 * visit() methods that return values explicitly upon being called. The calling of 
 * accept() has been moved to these visit methods for simplicity purposes.
 * 
 * Not all methods have been moved over. As of now, only the methods needed to be moved
 * have been moved since many of the preVisit() and postVisit() methods visit constraints
 * or expressions that don't need visit() functionality to accomplish my initial goal.
